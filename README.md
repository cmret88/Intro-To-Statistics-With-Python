Statistics with Python

#### What is Statistics? ####
# the field of statistics - the practice and study of collecting and analyzing data
# a summary statistic - a fact about or summary of some data

# What can statistics do?
# Can answer a bunch of questions:
# How likely is someone to purchase a product?
# how many occupants will your hotel have?
# how many sizes of jeans need to be manufactured so they can fit 95% of the population?
# A/B tests: which ad is more effective in getting people to purchase a product?

# What statistics can't do:
# Why is Game of Thrones so popular? (people might lie or leave out reasons)
# correlation vs. causation

# Types of statistics
# Descriptive stats
# describes and summarizes data
# ex. % breakdown of how people commute to work

# Inferential stats
# use a sample of data to make inferences about a larger population

# 2 Types of data:
# 1. Numeric (quantitative)
# 1a. Continuous (measured) such as airplane speed and time waiting in line
# 1b. Discrete (counted) such as # of pets or # of packages shipped
# 2. Categorical (qualitative)
# 2a. Nominal (unordered) - no inherent order (marriage status, country of residence)
# 2b. Ordinal (ordered) - has an inherent order, like a survey question where you have to select 'strongly disagree','somewhat agree', 'neither agree nor disagree', etc
# sometimes categorical data can be represented as numbers

# Why does data type matter?
# it matters because it helps us to know which sum stats and visualizations to use
